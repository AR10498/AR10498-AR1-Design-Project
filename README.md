# AR10498 Project Template Files

This is a library of python modules, classes and functions written to import and manipulate AutoCAD DXF files and perform structural calculations.

You are **not** expected to understand everything in this set of codes, just enough to be able to use and edit parts of it to perform useful tasks.

* There is a main file: `AR10498_Project_Template.ipynb` which should be run cell-by-cell and used as a template for your work
* have a look at the python `.py` modules so you can see how they are written
